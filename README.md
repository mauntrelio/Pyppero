# Pyppero

Simple WSGI/MongoDB framework for wildcard subdomain.

action.mydomain.tld/subrequest and mydomain.tld/action/subrequest are considered equivalent

"action" will be searched in a MongoDB collection, controller and view assigned, python controller dynamically loaded and executed. Where's the model? There's no model, this is not an MVC design pattern :)

More to be written and to be done.
